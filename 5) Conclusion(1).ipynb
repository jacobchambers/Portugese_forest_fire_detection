    "\n",
    "# We were not able to fit a good model. Both SVR and linear regression had negative r2 values which meant that they # were worse at predicting than just guessing with a horizontal line. Our ANN model was positive but had an r2 \n",
    "# value of 0.0122 which is extremely low and not useful for any analysis. In order to improve our models we would \n",

    "# We believe that the reason why our models were so weak is because of external data we were missing. For example, # fire fighter response to the fires is most likely one of the greatest factors. If the data for area burnt was \n",
    "# based on if the forest burned without human intervention, the models would likely be more accurate."
